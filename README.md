This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs related to loop counter initialization and provides a corrected version. The original code has a potential issue with counter initialization, leading to incorrect loop iterations. The corrected code addresses this by properly initializing the counter before the loop starts. This example highlights the importance of careful variable initialization in COBOL programming to ensure accurate and efficient execution of iterative processes.
